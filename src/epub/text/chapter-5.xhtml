			<p>A number of days passed, and Kmita did not return; but three men of Lauda came to Vodokty with complaints to the lady. Pakosh Gashtovt from Patsuneli came⁠—the same who was entertaining at his house Pan Volodyovski. He was the patriarch of the village, famed for wealth and six daughters, of whom three had married Butryms, and received each one hundred coined dollars as dowry, besides clothing and cattle. The second who came was Kassyan Butrym, who remembered Batory well, and with him the son-in-law of Pakosh, Yuzva Butrym; the latter, though in the prime of life⁠—he was not more than fifty years old⁠—did not go to Rossyeni to the registry of the general militia, for in the Cossack wars a cannonball had torn off his foot. He was called on this account Ankle-foot, or Yuzva Footless. He was a terrible man, with the strength of a bear, and great sense, but harsh, surly, judging men severely. For this reason he was feared somewhat in the capitals, for he could not pardon either himself or others. He was dangerous also when in liquor; but that happened rarely.</p>
			<p>These men came, then, to the lady, who received them graciously, though she divined at once that they had come to make complaints, and wanted to hear something from her regarding Pan Kmita.</p>
			<p>“We wish to pay our respects to Pan Kmita, but perhaps he has not come back yet from Upita,” said Pakosh; “so we have come to inquire, our dear darling, when it will be possible to see him.”</p>
			<p>“I think the only hindrance is that he is not here,” answered the lady. “He will be glad with his whole soul to see you, my guardians, for he has heard much good concerning you⁠—in old times from my grandfather, and lately from me.”</p>
			<p>“If only he does not receive us as he received the Domasheviches when they went to him with tidings of the colonel’s death,” muttered Yuzva, sullenly.</p>
			<p>The lady listened to the end, and answered at once with animation: “Be not unjust about that. Perhaps he did not receive them politely enough, but he has confessed his fault in this house. It should be remembered too that he was returning from a war in which he endured much toil and suffering. We must not wonder at a soldier, even if he snaps at his own, for warriors have tempers like sharp swords.”</p>
			<p>Pakosh Gashtovt, who wished always to be in accord with the whole world, waved his hand and said: “We did not wonder, either. A beast snaps at a beast when it sees one suddenly; why should not a man snap at a man? We will go to old Lyubich to greet Pan Kmita, so that he may live with us, go to war and to the wilderness, as the late under-chamberlain used to do.”</p>
			<p>“Well, tell us, dear darling, did he please you or did he not please you?” asked Kassyan Butrym. “It is our duty to ask this.”</p>
			<p>“God reward you for your care. Pan Kmita is an honorable cavalier, and even if I had found something against him it would not be proper to speak of it.”</p>
			<p>“But have you not seen something, our dearest soul?”</p>
			<p>“Nothing! Besides, no one has the right to judge him here, and God save us from showing distrust. Let us rather thank God.”</p>
			<p>“Why thank too early? When there will be something to thank for, then thank; if not, then not thank,” answered the sullen Yuzva, who, like a genuine man of Jmud, was very cautious and foreseeing.</p>
			<p>“Have you spoken about the marriage?” inquired Kassyan.</p>
			<p>Olenka dropped her eyes: “Pan Kmita wishes it as early as possible.”</p>
			<p>“That’s it! and why shouldn’t he wish it?” muttered Yuzva; “he is not a fool! What bear is it that does not want honey from a tree? But why hurry? Is it not better to see what kind of man he is? Father Kassyan, tell what you have on your tongue; do not doze like a hare at midday under a ridge.”</p>
			<p>“I am not dozing, I am only turning in my head what to say,” answered the old man. “The Lord Jesus has said, ‘As Kuba [Jacob] is to God, so will God be to Kuba.’ We wish no ill to Pan Kmita, if he wishes no ill to us⁠—which God grant, amen.”</p>
			<p>“If he will be to our thinking,” said Yuzva.</p>
			<p>Panna Billevich frowned with her falcon brows, and said with a certain haughtiness: “Remember that we are not receiving a servant. He will be master here; and his will must have force, not ours. He will succeed you in the guardianship.”</p>
			<p>“Does that mean that we must not interfere?” asked Yuzva.</p>
			<p>“It means that you are to be friends with him, as he wishes to be a friend of yours. Moreover he is taking care of his own property here, which each man manages according to his wish. Is not this true, Father Pakosh?”</p>
			<p>“The sacred truth,” answered the old man of Patsuneli.</p>
			<p>Yuzva turned again to old Butrym. “Do not doze, Father Kassyan!”</p>
			<p>“I am not dozing, I am only looking into my mind.”</p>
			<p>“Then tell what you see there.”</p>
			<p>“What do I see? This is what I see: Pan Kmita is a man of great family, of high blood, and we are small people. Moreover he is a soldier of fame; he alone opposed the enemy when all had dropped their hands⁠—God give as many as possible of such men! But he has a company that is worthless. Pan Pakosh, my neighbor, what have you heard about them from the Domasheviches? That they are all dishonored men, against whom outlawry has been declared, infamous and condemned, with declarations and trials hanging over them, children of the hangman. They were grievous to the enemy, but more grievous to their own people. They burned, they plundered, they rioted; that is what they did. They may have slain people in duels or carried out executions⁠—that happens to honest men; but they have lived in pure Tartar fashion, and long ago would have been rotting in prison but for the protection of Pan Kmita, who is a powerful lord. He favors and protects them, and they cling to him just as flies do in summer to a horse. Now they have come hither, and it is known to all what they are doing. The first day at Lyubich they fired out of pistols⁠—and at what?⁠—at the portraits of the dead Billeviches, which Pan Kmita should not have permitted, for the Billeviches are his benefactors.”</p>
			<p>Olenka covered her eyes with her hands. “It cannot be! it cannot be!”</p>
			<p>“It can, for it has been. He let them shoot at his benefactors, with whom he was to enter into relationship; and then they dragged the girls of the house into the room for debauchery. <i>Tfu!</i> an offence against God! That has never been among us! The first day they began shooting and dissoluteness⁠—the first day!”</p>
			<p>Here old Kassyan grew angry, and fell to striking the floor with his staff. On Olenka’s face were dark blushes, and Yuzva said⁠—</p>
			<p>“And Pan Kmita’s troops in Upita, are they better? Like officers, like men. Some people stole Pan Sollohub’s cattle; it is said they were Pan Kmita’s men. Some persons struck down on the road peasants of Meizagol who were drawing pitch. Who did this? They, the same soldiers. Pan Sollohub went to Pan Hlebovich for satisfaction, and now there is violence in Upita again. All this is in opposition to God. It used to be quiet here as in no other place, and now one must load a gun for the night and stand guard; but why? Because Pan Kmita and his company have come.”</p>
			<p>“Father Yuzva, do not talk so,” cried Olenka.</p>
			<p>“But how must I talk? If Pan Kmita is not to blame, why does he keep such men, why does he live with such men? Great mighty lady, tell him to dismiss them or give them up to the hangman, for otherwise there will be no peace. Is it a thing heard of to shoot at portraits and commit open debauchery? Why, the whole neighborhood is talking of nothing else.”</p>
			<p>“What have I to do?” asked Olenka. “They may be evil men, but he fought the war with them. If he will dismiss them at my request?”</p>
			<p>“If he does not dismiss them,” muttered Yuzva, in a low voice, “he is the same as they.”</p>
			<p>With this the lady’s blood began to boil against those men, murderers and profligates.</p>
			<p>“Let it be so. He must dismiss them. Let him choose me or them. If what you say is true⁠—and I shall know today if it is true⁠—I shall not forgive them either the shooting or the debauchery. I am alone and a weak orphan, they are an armed crowd; but I do not fear them.”</p>
			<p>“We will help you,” said Yuzva.</p>
			<p>“In God’s name,” continued Olenka, more and more excited, “let them do what they like, but not here in Lyubich. Let them be as they like⁠—that is their affair, their necks’ answer; but let them not lead away Pan Kmita to debauchery. Shame and disgrace! I thought they were awkward soldiers, but now I see that they are vile traitors, who stain both themselves and him. That’s the truth! Wickedness was looking out of their eyes; but I, foolish woman, did not recognize it. Well, I thank you, fathers, for opening my eyes on these Judases. I know what it beseems me to do.”</p>
			<p>“That’s it!” said old Kassyan. “Virtue speaks through you, and we will help you.”</p>
			<p>“Do not blame Pan Kmita, for though he has offended against good conduct he is young; and they tempt him, they lead him away, they urge him to license with example, and bring disgrace to his name. This is the condition; as I live, it will not last long.”</p>
			<p>Wrath roused Olenka’s heart more and more, and indignation at the comrades of Pan Kmita increased as pain increases in a wound freshly given; for terribly wounded in her were the love special to woman and that trust with which she had given her whole unmixed feeling to Pan Andrei. She was ashamed, for his sake and for her own, and anger and internal shame sought above all guilty parties.</p>
			<p>The nobles were glad when they saw their colonel’s granddaughter so terrible and ready for unyielding war against the disturbers from Orsha.</p>
			<p>She spoke on with sparkling eyes: “True, they are to blame; and they must leave not only Lyubich, but the whole countryside.”</p>
			<p>“Our heart, we do not blame Pan Kmita,” said old Kassyan. “We know that they tempt him. Not through bitterness nor venom against him have we come, but through regret that he keeps near his person revellers. It is evident, of course, that being young he is foolish. Even Pan Hlebovich the starosta was foolish when he was young, but now he keeps us all in order.”</p>
			<p>“And a dog,” said the mild old man from Patsuneli, with a voice of emotion⁠—“if you go with a young one to the field, won’t the fool instead of running after the game fall about your feet, begin to play, and tug you by the skirts?”</p>
			<p>Olenka wanted to say something, but suddenly she burst into tears.</p>
			<p>“Do not cry,” said Yuzva Butrym.</p>
			<p>“Do not cry, do not cry,” repeated the two old men.</p>
			<p>They tried to comfort her, but could not. After they had gone, care, anxiety, and as it were an offended feeling against them and against Pan Andrei remained. It pained the proud lady more and more deeply that she had to defend, justify, and explain him. But the men of that company! The delicate hands of the lady clinched at thought of them. Before her eyes appeared as if present the faces of Pan Kokosinski, Uhlik, Zend, Kulvyets-Hippocentaurus, and the others; and she discovered what she had not seen at first, that they were shameless faces, on which folly, licentiousness, and crime had all fixed their stamps in common. A feeling of hatred foreign to Olenka began to seize her as a rattling fire seizes fuel; but together with this outburst offence against Pan Kmita increased every minute.</p>
			<p>“Shame, disgrace,” whispered the maiden, with pallid lips, “that yesterday he went from me to house-wenches!” and she felt herself overborne. A crushing burden stopped the breath in her breast.</p>
			<p>It was growing raw out of doors. Panna Aleksandra walked in the room with hurried step, but anger was seething in her soul without ceasing. Hers was not the nature to endure the persecutions of fate without defending herself against them. There was knightly blood in the girl. She wanted straightway to begin a struggle with that band of evil spirits⁠—straightway. But what remained to her? Nothing, save tears and the prayer that Pan Andrei would send to the four winds those shame-bringing comrades. But if he will not do that⁠—And she did not dare to think more of the question.</p>
			<p>The meditations of the lady were interrupted by a youth who brought an armful of juniper sticks to the chimney, and throwing them down at the side of the hearth, began to pull out the coals from under the smouldering ashes. Suddenly a decision came to Olenka’s mind.</p>
			<p>“Kostek!” said she, “sit on horseback for me at once, and ride to Lyubich. If the master has returned, ask him to come here; but if he is not there, let the manager, old Znikis, mount with thee and come straight to me, and quickly.”</p>
			<p>The youth threw some bits of pitch on the coals and covered them with clumps of dry juniper. Bright flames began to crackle and snap in the chimney. It grew somewhat lighter in Olenka’s mind.</p>
			<p>“Perhaps the Lord God will change this yet,” thought she to herself, “and maybe it is not so bad as the guardians have said.”</p>
			<p>After a while she went to the servants’ room to sit, according to the immemorial custom of the Billeviches, with the maidens to oversee the spinning and sing hymns.</p>
			<p>In two hours Kostek entered, chilled from cold. “Znikis is in the antechamber,” said he. “The master is not in Lyubich.”</p>
			<p>The lady rose quickly. The manager in the antechamber bowed to her feet. “But how is your health, serene heiress? God give you the best.”</p>
			<p>They passed into the dining-hall; Znikis halted at the door.</p>
			<p>“What is to be heard among you people?” asked the lady.</p>
			<p>The peasant waved his hand. “Well, the master is not there.”</p>
			<p>“I know that, because he is in Upita. But what is going on in the house?”</p>
			<p>“Well!⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Listen, Znikis, speak boldly; not a hair will fall from thy head. People say that the master is good, but his companions wild?”</p>
			<p>“If they were only wild, serene lady!⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Speak candidly.”</p>
			<p>“But, lady, if it is not permitted me⁠—I am afraid⁠—they have forbidden me.”</p>
			<p>“Who has forbidden?”</p>
			<p>“My master.”</p>
			<p>“Has he?” asked the lady.</p>
			<p>A moment of silence ensued. She walked quickly in the room, with compressed lips and frowning brow. He followed her with his eyes. Suddenly she stopped before him.</p>
			<p>“To whom dost thou belong?”</p>
			<p>“To the Billeviches. I am from Vodokty, not from Lyubich.”</p>
			<p>“Thou wilt return no more to Lyubich; stay here. Now I command thee to tell all thou knowest.”</p>
			<p>The peasant cast himself on his knees at the threshold where he was standing. “Serene lady, I do not want to go back; the day of judgment is there. They are bandits and cutthroats; in that place a man is not sure of the day nor the hour.”</p>
			<p>Panna Billevich staggered as if stricken by an arrow. She grew very pale, but inquired calmly, “Is it true that they fired in the room, at the portraits?”</p>
			<p>“Of course they fired! And they dragged girls into their rooms, and every day the same debauchery. In the village is weeping, at the house Sodom and Gomorrah. Oxen are killed for the table, sheep for the table. The people are oppressed. Yesterday they killed the stable man without cause.”</p>
			<p>“Did they kill the stableman?”</p>
			<p>“Of course. And worst of all, they abused the girls. Those at the house are not enough for them; they chase others through the village.”</p>
			<p>A second interval of silence followed. Hot blushes came out on the lady’s face, and did not leave it.</p>
			<p>“When do they look for the master’s return?”</p>
			<p>“They do not know, my lady. But I heard, as they were talking to one another, that they would have to start tomorrow for Upita with their whole company. They gave command to have horses ready. They will come here and beg my lady for attendants and powder, because they need both there.”</p>
			<p>“They are to come here? That is well. Go now, Znikis, to the kitchen. Thou wilt return to Lyubich no more.”</p>
			<p>“May God give you health and happiness!”</p>
			<p>Panna Aleksandra had learned what she wanted, and she knew how it behooved her to act.</p>
			<p>The following day was Sunday. In the morning, before the ladies had gone to church, Kokosinski, Uhlik, Kulvyets-Hippocentaurus, Ranitski, Rekuts, and Zend arrived, followed by the servants at Lyubich, armed and on horseback, for the cavaliers had decided to march to Upita with succor for Kmita.</p>
			<p>The lady went out to meet them calmly and haughtily, altogether different from the woman who had greeted them for the first time a few days before. She barely motioned with her head in answer to their humble bows; but they thought that the absence of Pan Kmita made her cautious, and took no note of the real situation.</p>
			<p>Kokosinski stepped forward more confidently than the first time, and said⁠—</p>
			<p>“Serene great mighty lady, chief-hunter’s daughter, benefactress; we have come in here on our way to Upita to fall at the feet of our lady benefactress and beg for assistance, such as powder, and that you would permit your servants to mount their horses and go with us. We will take Upita by storm, and let out a little blood for the basswood-barks.”</p>
			<p>“It is a wonder to me,” answered Panna Billevich, “that you are going to Upita, when I heard myself how Pan Kmita commanded you to remain quietly in Lyubich, and I think that it beseems him to command and you to obey, as subordinates.”</p>
			<p>The cavaliers hearing these words looked at one another in astonishment. Zend pursed out his lips as if about to whistle in bird fashion. Kokosinski began to draw his broad palm over his head.</p>
			<p>“As true as life,” said he, “a man would think that you were speaking to Pan Kmita’s baggage-boys. It is true that we were to sit at home; but since the fourth day is passing and Yendrus has not come, we have reached the conviction that some serious tumult may have risen, in which our sabres, too, would be of service.”</p>
			<p>“Pan Kmita did not go to a battle, but to punish turbulent soldiers, and punishment may meet you also if you go against orders. Besides, a tumult and slashing might come to pass more quickly if you were there.”</p>
			<p>“It is hard to deliberate with your ladyship. We ask only for powder and men.”</p>
			<p>“Men and powder I will not give. Do you hear me, sirs!”</p>
			<p>“Do I hear correctly?” asked Kokosinski. “How is this? You will not give? You will spare in the rescue of Kmita, of Yendrus? Do you prefer that some evil should meet him?”</p>
			<p>“The greatest evil that can meet him is your company.”</p>
			<p>Here the maiden’s eyes began to flash lightning, and raising her head she advanced some steps toward the cutthroats, and they pushed back before her in astonishment.</p>
			<p>“Traitors!” said she, “you, like evil spirits, tempt him to sin; you persuade him on. But I know you⁠—your profligacy, your lawless deeds. Justice is hunting you; people turn away from you, and on whom does the shame fall? On him, through you who are outlaws, and infamous.”</p>
			<p>“Hei, by God’s wounds, comrades, do you hear?” cried Kokosinski. “Hei, what is this? Are we not sleeping, comrades?”</p>
			<p>Panna Billevich advanced another step, and pointing with her hand to the door, said, “Be off out of here!”</p>
			<p>The ruffians grew as pale as corpses, and no one of them found a word in answer. But their teeth began to gnash, their hands to quiver toward their sword-hilts, and their eyes to shoot forth malign gleams. After a moment, however, their spirits fell through alarm. That house too was under the protection of the powerful Kmita; that insolent lady was his betrothed. In view of this they gnawed their rage in silence, and she stood unflinchingly with flashing eyes pointing to the door with her finger.</p>
			<p>At last Kokosinski spoke in a voice broken with rage: “Since we are received here so courteously, nothing remains to us but to bow to the polished lady and go⁠—with thanks for the entertainment.”</p>
			<p>Then he bowed, touching the floor with his cap in purposed humility; after him all the others bowed, and went out in order. When the door closed after the last man, Olenka fell exhausted into the armchair, panting heavily, for she had not so much strength as daring.</p>
			<p>They assembled in counsel in front of the entrance near their horses, but no man wanted to speak first. At last Kokosinski said, “Well, dear lambs, what’s that?”</p>
			<p>“Do you feel well?”</p>
			<p>“Do you?”</p>
			<p>“<i>Ei!</i> but for Kmita,” said Ranitski, rubbing his hands convulsively, “we would revel with this lady here in our own fashion.”</p>
			<p>“Go meet Kmita,” piped Rekuts.</p>
			<p>Ranitski’s face was covered completely with spots, like the skin of a leopard. “I’ll meet him and you too, you reveller, wherever it may please you!”</p>
			<p>“That’s well!” cried Rekuts.</p>
			<p>Both rushed to their sabres, but the gigantic Kulvyets-Hippocentaurus thrust himself between. “See this fist!” said he, shaking as it were a loaf of bread; “see this fist!” repeated he. “I’ll smash the head of the first man who draws his sabre.” And he looked now at one and now at the other, as if asking in silence who wished to try first; but they, addressed in such fashion, were quiet at once.</p>
			<p>“Kulvyets is right,” said Kokosinski. “My dear lambs, we need agreement now more than ever. I would advise to go with all speed to Kmita, so that she may not see him first, for she would describe us as devils. It is well that none of us snarled at her, though my own hands and tongue were itching. If she is going to rouse him against us, it is better for us to rouse him first. God keep him from leaving us! Straightway the people here would surround us, hunt us down like wolves.”</p>
			<p>“Nonsense!” said Ranitski. “They will do nothing to us. There is war now; are there few men straggling through the world without a roof, without bread? Let us collect a party for ourselves, dear comrades, and let all the tribunals pursue us. Give your hand, Rekuts, I forgive you.”</p>
			<p>“I should have cut off your ears,” piped Rekuts; “but let us be friends, a common insult has met us.”</p>
			<p>“To order out cavaliers like us!” said Kokosinski.</p>
			<p>“And me, in whom is senatorial blood!” added Ranitski.</p>
			<p>“Honorable people, men of good birth!”</p>
			<p>“Soldiers of merit!”</p>
			<p>“And exiles!”</p>
			<p>“Innocent orphans!”</p>
			<p>“I have boots lined with wool, but my feet are freezing,” said Kulvyets. “Shall we stand like minstrels in front of this house? They will not bring us out heated beer. We are of no use here; let us mount and ride away. Better send the servants home, for what good are they without guns and weapons? We will go on alone.”</p>
			<p>“To Upita!”</p>
			<p>“To Yendrus, our worthy friend! We will make complaint before him.”</p>
			<p>“If only we do not miss him.”</p>
			<p>“To horse, comrades, to horse!”</p>
			<p>They mounted, and moved on at a walk, chewing their anger and shame. Outside the gate Ranitski, whom rage still held as it were by the throat, turned and threatened the house with his fist. “<i>Ei!</i> I want blood! I want blood!”</p>
			<p>“If we can only raise a quarrel between her and Kmita,” said Kokosinski, “we shall go through this place yet with fire.”</p>
			<p>“That may happen.”</p>
			<p>“God aid us!” added Uhlik.</p>
			<p>“Oh, pagan’s daughter, mad heath-hen!”</p>
			<p>Railing thus, and enraged at the lady, snarling sometimes too at themselves, they reached the forest. They had barely passed the first trees when an enormous flock of crows whirled above their heads. Zend began at once to croak in a shrill voice; thousands of voices answered him from above. The flock came down so low that the horses began to be frightened at the sound of their wings.</p>
			<p>“Shut your mouth!” cried Ranitski to Zend. “You’ll croak out misfortune on us yet. Those crows are circling over us as over carrion.”</p>
			<p>The others laughed. Zend croaked continually. The crows came down more and more, and the party rode as if in the midst of a storm. Fools! they could not see the ill omen.</p>
			<p>Beyond the forest appeared Volmontovichi, toward which the cavaliers moved at a trot, for the frost was severe; they were very cold, and it was still a long way to Upita, but they had to lessen their speed in the village itself. In the broad road of the village the space was full of people, as is usual on Sundays. The Butryms, men and women, were returning on foot and in sleighs from Mitruny after receiving indulgence. The nobles looked on these unknown horsemen, half guessing who they were. The young women, who had heard of their license in Lyubich and of the notorious public sinners whom Pan Kmita had brought, looked at them with still greater curiosity. But they rode proudly in imposing military posture, with velvet coats which they had captured, in panther-skin caps, and on sturdy horses. It was to be seen that they were soldiers by profession⁠—their gestures frequent and haughty, their right hands resting on their hips, their heads erect. They gave the way to no man, advancing in a line and shouting from time to time, “Out of the road!” One or another of the Butryms looked at them with a frown, but yielded; the party chatted among themselves about the village.</p>
			<p>“See, gentlemen,” said Kokosinski, “what sturdy fellows there are here; one after another like an aurochs, and each with the look of a wolf.”</p>
			<p>“If it were not for their stature and swords, they might be taken for common trash.”</p>
			<p>“Just look at those sabres⁠—regular tearers, as God is dear to me!” remarked Ranitski. “I would like to make a trial with some of those fellows.” Here he began to fence with his hand: “He thus, I thus! He thus, I thus⁠—and check!”</p>
			<p>“You can easily have that delight for yourself,” said Rekuts. “Not much is needed with them for a quarrel.”</p>
			<p>“I would rather engage with those girls over there,” said Zend, all at once.</p>
			<p>“They are candles, not girls!” cried Rekuts, with enthusiasm.</p>
			<p>“What do you say⁠—candles? Pine-trees! And each one has a face as if painted with crocus.”</p>
			<p>“It is hard to sit on a horse at such a sight.”</p>
			<p>Talking in this style, they rode out of the village and moved on again at a trot. After half an hour’s ride they came to a public house called Dola, which was halfway between Volmontovichi and Mitruny. The Butryms, men and women, generally stopped there going to and returning from church, in order to rest and warm themselves in frosty weather. So the cavaliers saw before the door a number of sleighs with pea-straw spread in them, and about the same number of saddle-horses.</p>
			<p>“Let us drink some <i xml:lang="uk-Latn">gorailka</i>, for it is cold,” said Kokosinski.</p>
			<p>“It wouldn’t hurt,” answered the others, in a chorus.</p>
			<p>They dismounted, left their horses at the posts, and entered the drinking-hall, which was enormous and dark. They found there a crowd of people⁠—nobles sitting on benches or standing in groups before the water-pail, drinking warmed beer, and some of them a punch made of mead, butter, <i xml:lang="pl">vudka</i>, and spice. Those were the Butryms themselves, stalwart and gloomy; so sparing of speech that in the room scarcely any conversation was heard. All were dressed in gray overcoats of homemade or coarse cloth from Rossyeni, lined with sheepskin; they had leather belts, with sabres in black iron scabbards. By reason of that uniformity of dress they had the appearance of soldiers. But they were old men of sixty or youths under twenty. These had remained at home for the winter threshing; the others, men in the prime of life, had gone to Rossyeni.</p>
			<p>When they saw the cavaliers of Orsha, they drew back from the water-bucket and began to examine them. Their handsome soldierly appearance pleased that warlike nobility; after a while, too, someone dropped the word⁠—</p>
			<p>“Are they from Lyubich?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, that is Pan Kmita’s company!”</p>
			<p>“Are these they?”</p>
			<p>“Of course.”</p>
			<p>The cavaliers drank <i xml:lang="uk-Latn">gorailka</i>, but the punch had a stronger odor. Kokosinski caught it first, and ordered some. They sat around a table then; and when the steaming kettle was brought they began to drink, looking around the room at the men and blinking, for the place was rather dark. The snow had blocked the windows; and the broad, low opening of the chimney in which the fire was burning was hidden completely by certain figures with their backs to the crowd.</p>
			<p>When the punch had begun to circulate in the veins of the cavaliers, bearing through their bodies an agreeable warmth, their cheerfulness, depressed by the reception at Vodokty, sprang up again; and all at once Zend fell to cawing like a crow, so perfectly that all faces were turned toward him.</p>
			<p>The cavaliers laughed, and the nobles, enlivened, began to approach, especially the young men⁠—powerful fellows with broad shoulders and plump cheeks. The figures sitting at the chimney turned their faces to the room, and Rekuts was the first to see that they were women.</p>
			<p>Zend closed his eyes and cawed, cawed. Suddenly he stopped, and in a moment those present heard the cry of a hare choked by a dog; the hare cried in the last agony, weaker and lower, then screamed in despair, and was silent for the ages; in place of it was heard the deep bellow of a furious stag as loud as in springtime.</p>
			<p>The Butryms were astonished. Though Zend had stopped, they expected to hear something again; but they heard only the piping voice of Rekuts⁠—</p>
			<p>“Those are titmice sitting near the chimney!”</p>
			<p>“That is true!” replied Kokosinski, shading his eyes with his hand.</p>
			<p>“As true as I live!” added Uhlik, “but it is so dark in the room that I could not see them.”</p>
			<p>“I am curious. What are they doing?”</p>
			<p>“Maybe they have come to dance.”</p>
			<p>“But wait; I will ask,” said Kokosinski. And raising his voice, he asked, “My dear women, what are you doing there at the chimney?”</p>
			<p>“We are warming our feet,” answered thin voices.</p>
			<p>Then the cavaliers rose and approached the hearth. There were sitting at it, on a long bench, about ten women, old and young, holding their bare feet on a log lying by the fire. On the other side of the log their shoes wet from the snow were drying.</p>
			<p>“So you are warming your feet?” asked Kokosinski.</p>
			<p>“Yes, for they are cold.”</p>
			<p>“Very pretty feet,” piped Rekuts, inclining toward the log.</p>
			<p>“But keep at a distance,” said one of the women.</p>
			<p>“I prefer to come near. I have a sure method, better than fire, for cold feet; which is⁠—only dance with a will, and the cold flies away.”</p>
			<p>“If to dance, then dance,” said Uhlik. “We want neither fiddles nor bass-viols. I will play for you on the flageolet.”</p>
			<p>Taking from its leather case which hung near his sabre the ever-present flageolet, he began to play; and the cavaliers, pushing forward with dancing movement to the maidens, sought to draw them from the benches. The maidens appeared to defend themselves, but more with their voices than their hands, for in truth they were not greatly opposed. Maybe the men, too, would have been willing in their turn; for against dancing on Sunday after Mass and during the carnival no one would protest greatly. But the reputation of the “company” was already too well known in Volmontovichi; therefore first the gigantic Yuzva Butrym, he who had but one foot, rose from the bench, and approaching Kulvyets-Hippocentaurus, caught him by the breast, held him, and said with sullen voice⁠—</p>
			<p>“If your grace wants dancing, then dance with me.”</p>
			<p>Kulvyets-Hippocentaurus blinked, and began to move his mustaches convulsively. “I prefer a girl,” said he; “I can attend to you afterward.”</p>
			<p>Meanwhile Ranitski ran up with face already spotted, for he sniffed a quarrel. “Who are you, road-blocker?” asked he, grasping his sabre.</p>
			<p>Uhlik stopped playing, and Kokosinski shouted, “Hei, comrades! together, together!”</p>
			<p>But the Butryms were already behind Yuzva; sturdy old men and great youths began to assemble, growling like bears.</p>
			<p>“What do you want? Are you looking for bruises?” asked Kokosinski.</p>
			<p>“No talk! Be off out of here!” said Yuzva, stolidly.</p>
			<p>Then Ranitski, whose interest it was that an hour should not pass without a fight, struck Yuzva with the hilt of his sword in the breast, so that it was heard in the whole room, and cried, “Strike!”</p>
			<p>Rapiers glittered; the scream of women was heard, the clatter of sabres, uproar and disturbance. Then the gigantic Yuzva pushed out of the crowd, took a roughly hewn bench from beside a table, and raising it as though it were a light strip of wood, shouted, “Make way! make way!”</p>
			<p>Dust rose from the floor and hid the combatants; but in the confusion groans were soon heard.</p>
