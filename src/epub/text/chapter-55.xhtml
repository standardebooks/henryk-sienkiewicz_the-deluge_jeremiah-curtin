			<h2 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">LV</h2>
			<p>At the moment when the king was saying that the <i xml:lang="sla">voevoda</i> of Vilna was standing, perhaps, before the judgment of God, he spoke as it were with a prophetic spirit, for at that hour the affair of Tykotsin was decided.</p>
			<p>On <time datetime="1655-12-25">December 25</time> Sapyeha was so sure of capturing Tykotsin that he went himself to Tyshovtsi, leaving the further conduct of the siege to Pan Oskyerko. He gave command to wait for the final storm till his return, which was to follow quickly; assembling, therefore, his more prominent officers, he said⁠—</p>
			<p>“Reports have come to me that among the officers there is a plan to bear apart on sabres the <i xml:lang="sla">voevoda</i> of Vilna immediately after capturing the castle. Now if the castle, as may happen, should surrender during my absence, I inform you, gentlemen, that I prohibit most strictly an attack on Radzivill’s life. I receive letters, it is true, from persons of whom you gentlemen do not even dream, not to let him live when I take him. But I do not choose to obey these commands; and this I do not from any compassion, for the traitor is not worthy of that, but because I have no right over his life, and I prefer to bring him before the Diet, so that posterity may have in this case an example that no greatness of family, no office can cover such offence, nor protect him from public punishment.”</p>
			<p>In this sense spoke the <i xml:lang="sla">voevoda</i> of Vityebsk, but more minutely, for his honesty was equalled by this weakness: he esteemed himself an orator, and loved on every occasion to speak copiously, and listened with delight to his own words, adding to them the most beautiful sentences from the ancients.</p>
			<p>“Then I must steep my right hand well in water,” answered Zagloba, “for it itches terribly. But I only say this, that if Radzivill had me in his hands, surely he would not spare my head till sunset. He knows well who in great part made his troops leave him; he knows well who embroiled him with the Swedes. But even if he does, I know not why I should be more indulgent to Radzivill than Radzivill to me.”</p>
			<p>“Because the command is not in your hands and you must obey,” said Sapyeha, with dignity.</p>
			<p>“That I must obey is true, but it is well at times also to obey Zagloba. I say this boldly, because if Radzivill had listened to me when I urged him to defend the country, he would not be in Tykotsin today, but in the field at the head of all the troops of Lithuania.”</p>
			<p>“Does it seem to you that the baton is in bad hands?”</p>
			<p>“It would not become me to say that, for I placed it in those hands. Our gracious lord, Yan Kazimir, has only to confirm my choice, nothing more.”</p>
			<p>The <i xml:lang="sla">voevoda</i> smiled at this, for he loved Zagloba and his jokes.</p>
			<p>“Lord brother,” said he, “you crushed Radzivill, you made me hetman, and all this is your merit. Permit me now to go in peace to Tyshovtsi, so that Sapyeha too may serve the country in something.”</p>
			<p>Zagloba put his hands on his hips, thought awhile as if he were considering whether he ought to permit or not; at last his eye gleamed, he nodded, and said with importance⁠—</p>
			<p>“Go, your grace, in peace.”</p>
			<p>“God reward you for the permission!” answered the <i xml:lang="sla">voevoda</i>, with a laugh.</p>
			<p>Other officers seconded the <i xml:lang="sla">voevoda</i>’s laugh. He was preparing to start, for the carriage was under the window; he took farewell of all, therefore, giving each instructions what to do during his absence; then approaching Volodyovski, he said⁠—</p>
			<p>“If the castle surrenders you will answer to me for the life of the <i xml:lang="sla">voevoda</i>.”</p>
			<p>“According to order! a hair will not fall from his head,” said the little knight.</p>
			<p>“Pan Michael,” said Zagloba to him, after the departure of the <i xml:lang="sla">voevoda</i>, “I am curious to know what persons are urging our Sapyo<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-32" id="noteref-32" epub:type="noteref">32</a> not to let Radzivill live when he captures him.”</p>
			<p>“How should I know?” answered the little knight.</p>
			<p>“If you say that what another mouth does not whisper to your ear your own will not suggest, you tell the truth! But they must be some considerable persons, since they are able to command the <i xml:lang="sla">voevoda</i>.”</p>
			<p>“Maybe it is the king himself.”</p>
			<p>“The king? If a dog bit the king he would forgive him that minute, and give him cheese in addition. Such is his heart.”</p>
			<p>“I will not dispute about that; but still, do they not say that he is greatly incensed at Radzivill?”</p>
			<p>“First, any man will succeed in being angry⁠—for example, my anger at Radzivill; secondly, how could he be incensed at Radzeyovski when he took his sons in guardianship, because the father was not better? That is a golden heart, and I think it is the queen who is making requests against the life of Radzivill. She is a worthy lady, not a word against that, but she has a woman’s mind; and know that if a woman is enraged at you, even should you hide in a crack of the floor, she will pick you out with a pin.”</p>
			<p>Volodyovski sighed at this, and said⁠—</p>
			<p>“Why should any woman be angry with me, since I have never made trouble for one in my life?”</p>
			<p>“Ah, but you would have been glad to do so. Therefore, though you serve in the cavalry, you rush on so wildly against the walls of Tykotsin with infantry, for you think not only is Radzivill there, but Panna Billevich. I know you, you rogue! Is it not true? You have not driven her out of your head yet.”</p>
			<p>“There was a time when I had put her thoroughly out of my head; and Kmita himself, if now here, would be forced to confess that my action was knightly, not wishing to act against people in love. I chose to forget my rebuff, but I will not hide this: if Panna Billevich is now in Tykotsin, and if God permits me a second time to save her from trouble, I shall see in that the expressed will of Providence. I need take no thought of Kmita, I owe him nothing; and the hope is alive in me that if he left her of his own will she must have forgotten him, and such a thing will not happen now as happened to me the first time.”</p>
			<p>Conversing in this way, they reached their quarters, where they found Pan Yan and Pan Stanislav, Roh Kovalski and the lord tenant of Vansosh, Jendzian.</p>
			<p>The cause of Sapyeha’s trip to Tyshovtsi was no secret, hence all the knights were pleased that so honorable a confederacy would rise in defence of the faith and the country.</p>
			<p>“Another wind is blowing now in the whole Commonwealth,” said Pan Stanislav, “and, thanks be to God, in the eyes of the Swedes.”</p>
			<p>“It began from Chenstohova,” answered Pan Yan. “There was news yesterday that the cloister holds out yet, and repulses more and more powerful assaults. Permit not, Most Holy Mother, the enemy to put Thy dwelling-place to shame.”</p>
			<p>Here Jendzian sighed and said: “Besides the holy images how much precious treasure would go into enemies’ hands; when a man thinks of that, food refuses to pass his throat!”</p>
			<p>“The troops are just tearing away to the assault; we can hardly hold them back,” said Pan Michael. “Yesterday Stankyevich’s squadron moved without orders and without ladders, for they said, ‘When we finish this traitor, we will go to relieve Chenstohova;’ and when any man mentions Chenstohova all grit their teeth and shake their sabres.”</p>
			<p>“Why have we so many squadrons here when one half would be enough for Tykotsin?” asked Zagloba. “It is the stubbornness of Sapyeha, nothing more. He does not wish to obey me; he wants to show that without my counsel he can do something. As you see yourselves, how are so many men to invest one paltry castle? They merely hinder one another, for there is not room for them all.”</p>
			<p>“Military experience speaks through you⁠—it is impossible!” answered Pan Stanislav.</p>
			<p>“Well, I have a head on my shoulders.”</p>
			<p>“Uncle has a head on his shoulders!” cried Pan Roh, suddenly; and straightening his mustaches, he began to look around on all present as if seeking someone to contradict him.</p>
			<p>“But the <i xml:lang="sla">voevoda</i> too has a head,” answered Pan Yan; “and if so many squadrons are here, there is danger that Prince Boguslav might come to the relief of his cousin.”</p>
			<p>“Then send a couple of light squadrons to ravage Electoral Prussia,” said Zagloba; “and summon volunteers there from among common people. I myself would be the first man to go to try Prussian beer.”</p>
			<p>“Beer is not good in winter, unless warmed,” remarked Pan Michael.</p>
			<p>“Then give us wine, or <i xml:lang="uk-Latn">gorailka</i>, or mead,” said Zagloba.</p>
			<p>Others also exhibited a willingness to drink; therefore the lord tenant of Vansosh occupied himself with that business, and soon a number of decanters were on the table. Hearts were glad at this sight, and the knights began to drink to one another, raising their goblets each time for a new health.</p>
			<p>“Destruction to the Swedes, may they not skin our bread very long!” said Zagloba. “Let them devour their pine cones in Sweden.”</p>
			<p>“To the health of his Royal Grace and the Queen!” said Pan Yan.</p>
			<p>“And to loyal men!” said Volodyovski.</p>
			<p>“Then to our own healths!”</p>
			<p>“To the health of Uncle!” thundered Kovalski.</p>
			<p>“God reward! Into your hands! and empty though your lips to the bottom. Zagloba is not yet entirely old! Worthy gentlemen! may we smoke this badger out of his hole with all haste, and move then to Chenstohova.”</p>
			<p>“To Chenstohova!” shouted Kovalski. “To the rescue of the Most Holy Lady.”</p>
			<p>“To Chenstohova!” cried all.</p>
			<p>“To defend the treasures of Yasna Gora from the Pagans!” added Jendzian.</p>
			<p>“Who pretend that they believe in the Lord Jesus, wishing to hide their wickedness; but in fact they only howl at the moon like dogs, and in this is all their religion.”</p>
			<p>“And such as these raise their hands against the splendors of Yasna Gora!”</p>
			<p>“You have touched the spot in speaking of their faith,” said Volodyovski to Zagloba, “for I myself have heard how they howl at the moon. They said afterward that they were singing Lutheran psalms; but it is certain that the dogs sing such psalms.”</p>
			<p>“How is that?” asked Kovalski. “Are there such people among them?”</p>
			<p>“There is no other kind,” answered Zagloba, with deep conviction.</p>
			<p>“And is their king no better?”</p>
			<p>“Their king is the worst of all. He began this war of purpose to blaspheme the true faith in the churches.”</p>
			<p>Here Kovalski, who had drunk much, rose and said: “If that is true, then as sure as you are looking at me, and as I am Kovalski, I’ll spring straight at the Swedish king in the first battle, and though he stood in the densest throng, that is nothing! My death or his! I’ll reach him with my lance⁠—hold me a fool, gentlemen, if I do not!”</p>
			<p>When he had said this he clinched his fist and was going to thunder on the table. He would have smashed the glasses and decanters, and broken the table; but Zagloba caught him hastily by the arm and said⁠—</p>
			<p>“Sit down, Roh, and give us peace. We will not think you a fool if you do not do this, but know that we will not stop thinking you a fool until you have done it. I do not understand, though, how you can raise a lance on the King of Sweden, when you are not in the hussars.”</p>
			<p>“I will join the escort and be enrolled in the squadron of Prince Polubinski; and my father will help me.”</p>
			<p>“Father Roh?”</p>
			<p>“Of course.”</p>
			<p>“Let him help you, but break not these glasses, or I’ll be the first man to break your head. Of what was I speaking, gentlemen? Ah! of Chenstohova. <i xml:lang="la">Luctus</i> (grief) will devour me, if we do not come in time to save the holy place. <i xml:lang="la">Luctus</i> will devour me, I tell you all! And all through that traitor Radzivill and the philosophical reasoning of Sapyeha.”</p>
			<p>“Say nothing against the <i xml:lang="sla">voevoda</i>. He is an honorable man,” said the little knight.</p>
			<p>“Why cover Radzivill with two halves when one is sufficient? Nearly ten thousand men are around this little booth of a castle, the best cavalry and infantry. Soon they will lick the soot out of all the chimneys in this region, for what was on the hearths they have eaten already.”</p>
			<p>“It is not for us to argue over the reasons of superiors, but to obey!”</p>
			<p>“It is not for you to argue, Pan Michael, but for me; half of the troops who abandoned Radzivill chose me as leader, and I would have driven Karl Gustav beyond the tenth boundary ere now, but for that luckless modesty which commanded me to place the baton in the hands of Sapyeha. Let him put an end to his delay, lest I take back what I gave.”</p>
			<p>“You are only so daring after drink,” said Volodyovski.</p>
			<p>“Do you say that? Well, you will see! This very day I will go among the squadrons and call out, ‘Gracious gentlemen, whoso chooses come with me to Chenstohova; it is not for you to wear out your elbows and knifes against the mortar of Tykotsin! I beg you to come with me! Whoso made me commander, whoso gave me power, whoso had confidence that I would do what was useful for the country and the faith, let him stand at my side. It is a beautiful thing to punish traitors, but a hundred times more beautiful to save the Holy Lady, our Mother and the Patroness of this kingdom from oppression and the yoke of the heretic.’ ”</p>
			<p>Here Zagloba, from whose forelock the steam had for some time been rising, started up from his place, sprang to a bench, and began to shout as if he were before an assembly⁠—</p>
			<p>“Worthy gentlemen! whoso is a Catholic, whoso a Pole, whoso has pity on the Most Holy Lady, let him follow me! To the relief of Chenstohova!”</p>
			<p>“I go!” shouted Roh Kovalski.</p>
			<p>Zagloba looked for a while on those present, and seeing astonishment and silent faces, he came down from the bench and said⁠—</p>
			<p>“I’ll teach Sapyeha reason! I am a rascal if by tomorrow I do not take half the army from Tykotsin and lead it to Chenstohova.”</p>
			<p>“For God’s sake, restrain yourself, father!” said Pan Yan.</p>
			<p>“I’m a rascal, I tell you!” repeated Zagloba.</p>
			<p>They were frightened lest he should carry out his threat, for he was able to do so. In many squadrons there was murmuring at the delay in Tykotsin; men really gnashed their teeth thinking of Chenstohova. It was enough to cast a spark on that powder; and what if a man so stubborn, of such immense knightly importance as Zagloba, should cast it? To begin with, the greater part of Sapyeha’s army was composed of new recruits, and therefore of men unused to discipline, and ready for action on their own account, and they would have gone as one man without doubt after Zagloba to Chenstohova.</p>
			<p>Therefore both Skshetuskis were frightened at this undertaking, and Volodyovski cried⁠—</p>
			<p>“Barely has a small army been formed by the greatest labor of the <i xml:lang="sla">voevoda</i>, barely is there a little power for the defence of the Commonwealth, and you wish with disorder to break up the squadrons, bring them to disobedience. Radzivill would pay much for such counsel, for it is water to his mill. Is it not a shame for you to speak of such a deed?”</p>
			<p>“I’m a scoundrel if I don’t do it!” said Zagloba.</p>
			<p>“Uncle will do it!” said Kovalski.</p>
			<p>“Silence, you horse-skull!” roared out Pan Michael.</p>
			<p>Pan Roh stared, shut his mouth, and straightened himself at once.</p>
			<p>Then Volodyovski turned to Zagloba: “And I am a scoundrel if one man of my squadron goes with you; you wish to ruin the army, and I tell you that I will fall first upon your volunteers.”</p>
			<p>“O Pagan, faithless Turk!” said Zagloba. “How is that? you would attack knights of the Most Holy Lady? Are you ready? Well, I know you! Do you think, gentlemen, that it is a question with him of an army or discipline? No! he sniffs Panna Billevich behind the walls of Tykotsin. For a private question, for your own wishes you would not hesitate to desert the best cause. You would be glad to flutter around a maiden, to stand on one foot, then the other, and display yourself. But nothing will come of this! My head for it, that better than you are running after her, even that same Kmita, for even he is no worse than you.”</p>
			<p>Volodyovski looked at those present, taking them to witness what injustice was done him; then he frowned. They thought he would burst out in anger, but because he had been drinking, he fell all at once into tenderness.</p>
			<p>“This is my reward,” said he. “From the years of a stripling I have served the country; I have not put the sabre out of my hand! I have neither cottage, wife, nor children; my head is as lone as a lance-point. The most honorable think of themselves, but I have no rewards save wounds in the flesh; nay, I am accused of selfishness, almost held a traitor.”</p>
			<p>Tears began to drop on his yellow mustaches. Zagloba softened in a moment, and throwing open his arms, cried⁠—</p>
			<p>“Pan Michael, I have done you cruel injustice! I should be given to the hangman for having belittled such a tried friend!”</p>
			<p>Then falling into mutual embraces, they began to kiss each other; they drank more to good understanding, and when sorrow had gone considerably out of his heart, Volodyovski said⁠—</p>
			<p>“But you will not ruin the army, bring disobedience, and give an evil example?”</p>
			<p>“I will not, Pan Michael, I will not for your sake.”</p>
			<p>“God grant us to take Tykotsin; whose affair is it what I seek behind the walls of the fortress? Why should any man jeer at me?”</p>
			<p>Struck by that question, Zagloba began to put the ends of his mustaches in his mouth and gnaw them; at last he said: “Pan Michael, I love you as the apple of my eye, but drive that Panna Billevich out of your head.”</p>
			<p>“Why?” asked Pan Michael, with astonishment.</p>
			<p>“She is beautiful, <i xml:lang="la">assentior</i> (I agree),” answered Zagloba, “but she is distinguished in person, and there is no proportion whatever between you. You might sit on her shoulder, like a canary-bird, and peck sugar out of her mouth. She might carry you like a falcon on her glove, and let you off against every enemy, for though you are little you are venomous like a hornet.”</p>
			<p>“Well, have you begun?” asked Volodyovski.</p>
			<p>“If I have begun, then let me finish. There is one woman as if created for you, and she is precisely that kernel⁠—What is her name? That one whom Podbipienta was to marry?”</p>
			<p>“Anusia Borzobogati!” cried Pan Yan. “She is indeed an old love of Michael’s.”</p>
			<p>“A regular grain of buckwheat, but a pretty little rogue; just like a doll,” said Zagloba, smacking his lips.</p>
			<p>Volodyovski began to sigh, and to repeat time after time what he always repeated when mention was made of Anusia: “What is happening to the poor girl? Oh, if she could only be found!”</p>
			<p>“You would not let her out of your hands, for, God bless me, I have not seen in my life any man so given to falling in love. You ought to have been born a rooster, scratch the sweepings in a house-yard, and cry, <i>Co, co, co</i>, at the topknots.”</p>
			<p>“Anusia! Anusia!” repeated Pan Michael. “If God would send her to me⁠—But perhaps she is not in the world, or perhaps she is married⁠—”</p>
			<p>“How could she be? She was a green turnip when I saw her, and afterward, even if she ripened, she may still be in the maiden state. After such a man as Podbipienta she could not take any common fellow. Besides, in these times of war few are thinking of marriage.”</p>
			<p>“You did not know her well,” answered Pan Michael. “She was wonderfully honest; but she had such a nature that she let no man pass without piercing his heart. The Lord God created her thus. She did not miss even men of lower station; for example, Princess Griselda’s physician, that Italian, who was desperately in love with her. Maybe she has married him and he has taken her beyond the sea.”</p>
			<p>“Don’t talk such nonsense, Michael!” cried Zagloba, with indignation. “A doctor, a doctor⁠—that the daughter of a noble of honorable blood should marry a man of such low estate! I have already said that that is impossible.”</p>
			<p>“I was angry with her myself, for I thought, ‘This is without limit; soon she will be turning the heads of attorneys.’ ”</p>
			<p>“I prophesy that you will see her yet,” said Zagloba.</p>
			<p>Further conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Pan Tokarzevich, who had served formerly with Radzivill, but after the treason of the hetman, left him, in company with others, and was now standard-bearer in Oskyerko’s regiment.</p>
			<p>“Colonel,” said he to Volodyovski, “we are to explode a petard.”</p>
			<p>“Is Pan Oskyerko ready?”</p>
			<p>“He was ready at midday, and he is not willing to wait, for the night promises to be dark.”</p>
			<p>“That is well; we will go to see. I will order the men to be ready with muskets, so that the besieged may not make a sortie. Will Pan Oskyerko himself explode the petard?”</p>
			<p>“He will⁠—in his own person. A crowd of volunteers go with him.”</p>
			<p>“And I will go!” said Volodyovski.</p>
			<p>“And we!” cried Pan Yan and Pan Stanislav.</p>
			<p>“Oh, ’tis a pity that old eyes cannot see in the dark,” said Zagloba, “for of a surety I should not let you go alone. But what is to be done? When dusk comes I cannot draw my sword. In the daytime, in the daytime, in the sunlight, then the old man likes to move to the field. Give me the strongest of the Swedes, if at midday.”</p>
			<p>“But I will go,” said, after some thought, the tenant of Vansosh. “When they blow up the gate the troops will spring to the storm in a crowd, and in the castle there may be great wealth in plate and in jewels.”</p>
			<p>All went out, for it was now growing dark; in the quarters Zagloba alone remained. He listened for a while to the snow squeaking under the steps of the departing men, then began to raise one after another the decanters, and look through them at the light burning in the chimney to see if there was something yet in any of them.</p>
			<p>The others marched toward the castle in darkness and wind, which rose from the north and blew with increasing force, howling, storming, bringing with it clouds of snow broken fine.</p>
			<p>“A good night to explode a petard!” said Volodyovski.</p>
			<p>“But also for a sortie,” answered Pan Yan. “We must keep a watchful eye and ready muskets.”</p>
			<p>“God grant,” said Pan Tokarzevich, “that at Chenstohova there is a still greater storm. It is always warmer for our men behind the walls. But may the Swedes freeze there on guard, may they freeze!”</p>
			<p>“A terrible night!” said Pan Stanislav; “do you hear, gentlemen, how it howls, as if Tartars were rushing through the air to attack?”</p>
			<p>“Or as if devils were singing a requiem for Radzivill!” said Volodyovski.</p>
