			<h2 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">LVIII</h2>
			<p>After these solemnities various tidings flew into Lvoff like winged birds. There were older and fresh tidings more or less favorable, but all increased courage. First the confederation of Tyshovtsi grew like a conflagration; everyone living joined it, nobles as well as peasants. Towns furnished wagons, firearms, and infantry; the Jews money. No one dared to oppose the manifestoes; the most indolent mounted. There came also a terrible manifesto from Wittemberg, turned against the confederation. Fire and sword were to punish those who joined it. This manifesto produced the same effect as if a man tried to quench flames with powder. The manifesto, with the knowledge assuredly of the king, and to rouse hatred more thoroughly against the Swedes, was scattered through Lvoff in great numbers, and it is not becoming to state what common people did with the copies; it suffices to say that the wind bore them terribly dishonored through the streets of the city, and the students showed, to the delight of crowds, “Wittemberg’s Confusion,” singing at the same time the song beginning with these words⁠—</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">
				<p>
					<span>“O Wittemberg, poor man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Race across over the sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Like a hare!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when thy buttons are lost</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou wilt drop down thy trousers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">While racing away!”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>And Wittemberg, as if making the words of the song true, gave up his command in Krakow to the valiant Wirtz, and betook himself hurriedly to Elblang, where the King of Sweden was sojourning with the queen, spending his time at feasts, and rejoicing in his heart that he had become the lord of such an illustrious kingdom.</p>
			<p>Accounts came also to Lvoff of the fall of Tykotsin, and minds were gladdened. It was strange that men had begun to speak of that event before a courier had come; only they did not say whether Radzivill had died or was in captivity. It was asserted, however, that Sapyeha, at the head of a considerable force, had gone from Podlyasye to Lyubelsk to join the hetmans; that on the road he was beating the Swedes and growing in power every day.</p>
			<p>At last envoys came from Sapyeha himself in a considerable number, for the <i xml:lang="sla">voevoda</i> had sent neither less nor more than one whole squadron to be at the disposal of the king, desiring in this way to show honor to the sovereign, to secure his person from every possible accident, and perhaps specially to increase his significance.</p>
			<p>The squadron was brought by Volodyovski, well known to the king; so Yan Kazimir gave command that he should stand at once in his presence, and taking Pan Michael’s head between his hands, he said⁠—</p>
			<p>“I greet thee, famous soldier! Much water has flowed down since we lost sight of thee. I think that we saw thee last at Berestechko, all covered with blood.”</p>
			<p>Pan Michael bent to the knees of the king, and said⁠—</p>
			<p>“It was later, in Warsaw, Gracious Lord; also in the castle with the present castellan of Kiev, Pan Charnyetski.”</p>
			<p>“But are you serving all the time? Had you no desire to enjoy leisure at home?”</p>
			<p>“No; for the Commonwealth was in need, and besides, in these public commotions my property has been lost. I have no place in which to put my head, Gracious Lord; but I am not sorry for myself, thinking that the first duty of a soldier is to the king and the country.”</p>
			<p>“Ah, would there were more such! The enemy would not be so rich. God grant the time for rewards will come; but now tell me what you have done with the <i xml:lang="sla">voevoda</i> of Vilna?”</p>
			<p>“The <i xml:lang="sla">voevoda</i> of Vilna is before the judgment of God. The soul went out of him just as we were going to the final storm.”</p>
			<p>“How was that?”</p>
			<p>“Here is Pan Sapyeha’s report,” said Volodyovski.</p>
			<p>The king took Sapyeha’s letter and began to read; he had barely begun when he stopped.</p>
			<p>“Pan Sapyeha is mistaken,” said he, “when he writes that the grand baton of Lithuania is unoccupied; it is not, for I give it to him.”</p>
			<p>“There is no one more worthy,” said Pan Michael, “and to your Royal Grace the whole army will be grateful till death for this deed.”</p>
			<p>The king smiled at the simple soldierly confidence, and read on. After a while he sighed, and said⁠—</p>
			<p>“Radzivill might have been the first pearl in this glorious kingdom, if pride and the errors which he committed had not withered his soul. It is accomplished! Inscrutable are the decisions of God! Radzivill and Opalinski⁠—almost in the same hour! Judge them, O Lord, not according to their sins, but according to Thy mercy.”</p>
			<p>Silence followed; then the king again began to read.</p>
			<p>“We are thankful to the <i xml:lang="sla">voevoda</i>,” said he, when he had finished, “for sending a whole squadron and under the greatest cavalier, as he writes. But I am safe here; and cavaliers, especially such as you, are more needed in the field. Rest a little, and then I will send you to assist Charnyetski, for on him evidently the greatest pressure will be turned.”</p>
			<p>“We have rested enough already at Tykotsin, Gracious Lord,” said the little knight, with enthusiasm; “if our horses were fed a little, we might move today, for with Charnyetski there will be unspeakable delights. It is a great happiness to look on the face of our gracious lord, but we are anxious to see the Swedes.”</p>
			<p>The king grew radiant. A fatherly kindness appeared on his face, and he said, looking with pleasure on the sulphurous figure of the little knight⁠—</p>
			<p>“You were the first little soldier to throw the baton of a colonel at the feet of the late prince <i xml:lang="sla">voevoda</i>.”</p>
			<p>“Not the first, your Royal Grace; but it was the first, and God grant the last, time for me to act against military discipline.” Pan Michael stopped, and after a while added, “It was impossible to do otherwise.”</p>
			<p>“Certainly,” said the king. “That was a grievous hour for those who understood military duty; but obedience must have its limits, beyond which guilt begins. Did many officers remain in with Radzivill?”</p>
			<p>“In Tykotsin we found only one officer, Pan Kharlamp, who did not leave the prince at once, and who did not wish afterward to desert him in misery. Compassion alone kept Kharlamp with Radzivill, for natural affection drew him to us. We were barely able to restore him to health, such hunger had there been in Tykotsin, and he took the food from his own mouth to nourish the prince. He has come here to Lvoff to implore pardon of your Royal Grace, and I too fall at your feet for him; he is a tried and good soldier.”</p>
			<p>“Let him come hither,” said the king.</p>
			<p>“He has also something important to tell, which he heard in Kyedani from the mouth of Prince Boguslav, and which relates to the person of your Royal Grace, which is sacred to us.”</p>
			<p>“Is this about Kmita?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, Gracious Lord.”</p>
			<p>“Did you know Kmita?”</p>
			<p>“I knew him and fought with him; but where he is now, I know not.”</p>
			<p>“What do you think of him?”</p>
			<p>“Gracious Lord, since he undertook such a deed there are no torments of which he is not worthy, for he is an abortion of hell.”</p>
			<p>“That story is untrue,” said the king; “it is all an invention of Prince Boguslav. But putting that affair aside, what do you know of Kmita in times previous?”</p>
			<p>“He was always a great soldier, and in military affairs incomparable. He used to steal up to Hovanski so that with a few hundred people he brought the whole force of the enemy to misery; no other man could have done that. It is a miracle that the skin was not torn from him and stretched over a drum. If at that time someone had placed Prince Radzivill himself in the hands of Hovanski, he would not have given him so much pleasure as he would had he made him a present of Kmita. Why! it went so far that Kmita ate out of Hovanski’s camp-chests, slept on his rugs, rode in his sleighs and on his horse. But he was an infliction on his own people too, terribly self-willed; like Pan Lashch, he might have lined his cloak with sentences, and in Kyedani he was lost altogether.”</p>
			<p>Here Volodyovski related in detail all that had happened in Kyedani.</p>
			<p>Yan Kazimir listened eagerly, and when at last Pan Michael told how Zagloba had freed first himself and then all his comrades from Radzivill’s captivity, the king held his sides from laughter.</p>
			<p>“<i xml:lang="la">Vir incomparabilis! vir incomparabilis</i> (an incomparable man)!” he repeated. “But is he here with you?”</p>
			<p>“At the command of your Royal Grace!” answered Volodyovski.</p>
			<p>“That noble surpasses Ulysses! Bring him to me to dinner for a pleasant hour, and also the Skshetuskis; and now toll me what you know more of Kmita.”</p>
			<p>“From letters found on Roh Kovalski we learned that we were sent to Birji to die. The prince pursued us afterward and tried to surround us, but he did not take us. We escaped luckily. And that was not all, for not far from Kyedani we caught Kmita, whom I sent at once to be shot.”</p>
			<p>“Oh!” said the king, “I see that you had sharp work there in Lithuania.”</p>
			<p>“But first Pan Zagloba had him searched to find letters on his person. In fact, a letter from the hetman was found, in which we learned that had it not been for Kmita we should not have been taken to Birji, but would have been shot without delay in Kyedani.”</p>
			<p>“But you see!” said the king.</p>
			<p>“In view of that we could not take his life. We let him go. What he did further I know not, but he did not leave Radzivill at that time. God knows what kind of man he is. It is easier to form an opinion of anyone else than of such a whirlwind. He remained with Radzivill and then went somewhere. Later he warned us that the prince was marching from Kyedani. It is hard to belittle the notable service he did us, for had it not been for that warning Radzivill would have fallen on unprepared troops, and destroyed the squadrons one after the other. I know not myself, Gracious Lord, what to think⁠—whether that was a calumny which Prince Boguslav uttered.”</p>
			<p>“That will appear at once,” said the king; and he clapped his hands. “Call hither Pan Babinich!” said he to a page who appeared on the threshold.</p>
			<p>The page vanished, and soon the door of the king’s chamber opened, and in it stood Pan Andrei. Volodyovski did not know him at once, for he had changed greatly and grown pale, as he had not recovered from the struggle in the pass. Pan Michael therefore looked at him without recognition.</p>
			<p>“It is a wonder,” said he at last; “were it not for the thinness of lips and because your Royal Grace gives another name, I should say this is Pan Kmita.”</p>
			<p>The king smiled and said⁠—</p>
			<p>“This little knight has just told me of a terrible disturber of that name, but I explained as on my palm that he was deceived in his judgment, and I am sure that Pan Babinich will confirm what I say.”</p>
			<p>“Gracious Lord,” answered Babinich, quickly, “one word from your grace will clear that disturber more than my greatest oath.”</p>
			<p>“And the voice is the same,” said Pan Michael, with growing astonishment; “but that wound across the mouth was not there.”</p>
			<p>“Worthy sir,” answered Kmita, “the head of a noble is a register on which sometimes a man’s hand writes with a sabre. And here is your note; recognize it.”</p>
			<p>He bowed his head, shaven at the sides, and pointed at the long whitish scar.</p>
			<p>“My hand!” cried Volodyovski.</p>
			<p>“But I say that you do not know Kmita,” put in the king.</p>
			<p>“How is that, Gracious Lord?”</p>
			<p>“For you know a great soldier, but a self-willed one, an associate in the treason of Radzivill. But here stands the Hector of Chenstohova, to whom, next to Kordetski, Yasna Gora owes most; here stands the defender of the country and my faithful servant, who covered me with his own breast and saved my life when in the pass I had fallen among the Swedes as among wolves. Such is this new Kmita. Know him and love him, for he deserves it.”</p>
			<p>Volodyovski began to move his yellow mustaches, not knowing what to say; and the king added⁠—</p>
			<p>“And know that not only did he promise Prince Boguslav nothing, but he began on him the punishment for Radzivill intrigues, for he seized him and intended to give him into your hands.”</p>
			<p>“And he warned us against Prince Yanush!” cried Volodyovski. “What angel converted you?”</p>
			<p>“Embrace each other!” said the king.</p>
			<p>“I loved you at once!” said Kmita to Volodyovski.</p>
			<p>Then they fell into each other’s embraces, and the king looked on them and pursed out his lips with delight, time after time, as was his habit. But Kmita embraced the little knight with such feeling that he raised him as he would a cat, and not soon did he place him back on his feet.</p>
			<p>Then the king went to the daily council, for the two hetmans of the kingdom had come to Lvoff, they were to form the army there, and lead it later to the aid of Charnyetski, and the confederate divisions marching, under various leaders, throughout the country.</p>
			<p>The knights were alone.</p>
			<p>“Come to my quarters,” said Volodyovski; “you will find there Pan Yan, Pan Stanislav, and Zagloba, who will be glad to hear what the king has told me. There too is Kharlamp.”</p>
			<p>But Kmita approached the little knight with great disquiet on his face. “Did you find many people with Radzivill?” asked he.</p>
			<p>“Of officers, Kharlamp alone was there.”</p>
			<p>“I do not ask about the military, but about women.”</p>
			<p>“I know what you mean,” answered Pan Michael, flushing somewhat. “Prince Boguslav took Panna Billevich to Taurogi.”</p>
			<p>Kmita’s face changed at once; first it was pale as a parchment, then purple, and again whiter than before. He did not find words at once; but his nostrils quivered while he was catching breath, which apparently failed in his breast. Then he seized his temples with both hands, and running through the room like a madman, began to repeat⁠—</p>
			<p>“Woe to me, woe, woe!”</p>
			<p>“Come! Kharlamp will tell you better, for he was present,” said Volodyovski.</p>
