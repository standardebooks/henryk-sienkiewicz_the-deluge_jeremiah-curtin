			<p>After that victory Charnyetski permitted at last the army to take breath and feed the wearied horses; then he was to return to Sandomir by forced marches, and bend the King of Sweden to his fall.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile Kharlamp came to the camp one evening with news from Sapyeha. Charnyetski was at Chersk, whither he had gone to review the general militia assembled at that town. Kharlamp, not finding the chief, betook himself at once to Pan Michael, so as to rest at his quarters after the long journey.</p>
			<p>His friends greeted him joyously; but he, at the very beginning, showed them a gloomy face and said⁠—</p>
			<p>“I have heard of your victory. Fortune smiled here, but bore down on us in Sandomir. Karl Gustav is no longer in the sack, for he got out, and, besides, with great confusion to the Lithuanian troops.”</p>
			<p>“Can that be?” cried Pan Michael, seizing his head.</p>
			<p>Pan Yan, Pan Stanislav, and Zagloba were as if fixed to the earth.</p>
			<p>“How was it? Tell, by the living God, for I cannot stay in my skin!”</p>
			<p>“Breath fails me yet,” said Kharlamp; “I have ridden day and night, I am terribly tired. Charnyetski will come, then I will tell all from the beginning. Let me now draw breath a little.”</p>
			<p>“Then Karl has gone out of the sack. I foresaw that, did I not? Do you not remember that I prophesied it? Let Kovalski testify.”</p>
			<p>“Uncle foretold it,” said Roh.</p>
			<p>“And whither has Karl gone?” asked Pan Michael.</p>
			<p>“The infantry sailed down in boats; but he, with cavalry, has gone along the Vistula to Warsaw.”</p>
			<p>“Was there a battle?”</p>
			<p>“There was and there was not. In brief, give me peace, for I cannot talk.”</p>
			<p>“But tell me one thing. Is Sapyeha crushed altogether?”</p>
			<p>“How crushed! He is pursuing the king; but of course Sapyeha will never come up with anybody.”</p>
			<p>“He is as good at pursuit as a German at fasting,” said Zagloba.</p>
			<p>“Praise be to God for even this, that the army is intact!” put in Volodyovski.</p>
			<p>“The Lithuanians have got into trouble!” said Zagloba. “Ah, it is a bad case! Again we must watch a hole in the Commonwealth together.”</p>
			<p>“Say nothing against the Lithuanian army,” said Kharlamp. “Karl Gustav is a great warrior, and it is no wonder to lose against him. And did not you, from Poland, lose at Uistsie, at Volbor, at Suleyov, and in ten other places? Charnyetski himself lost at Golembo. Why should not Sapyeha lose, especially when you left him alone like an orphan?”</p>
			<p>“But why did we go to a dance at Varka?” asked Zagloba, with indignation.</p>
			<p>“I know that it was not a dance, but a battle, and God gave you the victory. But who knows, perhaps it had been better not to go; for among us they say that the troops of both nations (Lithuanian and Poland) may be beaten separately, but together the cavalry of hell itself could not manage them.”</p>
			<p>“That may be,” said Volodyovski; “but what the leaders have decided is not for us to discuss. This did not happen, either, without your fault.”</p>
			<p>“Sapyo must have blundered; I know him!” said Zagloba.</p>
			<p>“I cannot deny that,” muttered Kharlamp.</p>
			<p>They were silent awhile, but from time to time looked at one another gloomily, for to them it seemed that the fortune of the Commonwealth was beginning to sink, and yet such a short time before they were full of hope and confidence.</p>
			<p>“Charnyetski is coming!” said Volodyovski; and he went out of the room.</p>
			<p>The castellan was really returning; Volodyovski went to meet him, and began to call from a distance⁠—</p>
			<p>“The King of Sweden has broken through the Lithuanian army, and escaped from the sack. There is an officer here with letters from the <i xml:lang="sla">voevoda</i> of Vilna.”</p>
			<p>“Bring him here!” cried Charnyetski. “Where is he?”</p>
			<p>“With me; I will present him at once.”</p>
			<p>Charnyetski took the news so much to heart that he would not wait, but sprang at once from his saddle and entered Volodyovski’s quarters.</p>
			<p>All rose when they saw him enter; he barely nodded and said⁠—</p>
			<p>“I ask for the letter!”</p>
			<p>Kharlamp gave him a sealed letter. The castellan went to the window, for it was dark in the cottage, and began to read with frowning brow and anxious face. From instant to instant anger gleamed on his countenance.</p>
			<p>“The castellan has changed,” whispered Zagloba to Pan Yan; “see how his beak has grown red. He will begin to lisp right away, he always does when in anger.”</p>
			<p>Charnyetski finished the letter. For a time he twisted his beard with his whole hand; at last he called out with a jingling, indistinct voice⁠—</p>
			<p>“Come this way, officer!”</p>
			<p>“At command of your worthiness!”</p>
			<p>“Tell me the truth,” said Charnyetski, with emphasis, “for this narrative is so artfully put together that I am unable to get at the affair. But⁠—tell me the truth, do not color it⁠—is the army dispersed?”</p>
			<p>“Not dispersed at all, your grace.”</p>
			<p>“How many days are needed to assemble it?”</p>
			<p>Here Zagloba whispered to Pan Yan: “He wants to come at him from the left hand as it were.”</p>
			<p>But Kharlamp answered without hesitation⁠—</p>
			<p>“Since the army is not dispersed, it does not need to be assembled. It is true that when I was leaving, about five hundred horse of the general militia could not be found, were not among the fallen; but that is a common thing, and the army does not suffer from that; the hetman has even moved after the king in good order.”</p>
			<p>“You have lost no cannon?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, we lost four, which the Swedes, not being able to take with them, spiked.”</p>
			<p>“I see that you tell the truth; tell me then how everything happened.”</p>
			<p>“<i xml:lang="la">Incipiam</i> (I will begin),” said Kharlamp. “When we were left alone, the enemy saw that there was no army on the Vistula, nothing but parties and irregular detachments. We thought⁠—or, properly speaking, Pan Sapyeha thought⁠—that the king would attack those, and he sent reinforcements, but not considerable, so as not to weaken himself. Meanwhile there was a movement and a noise among the Swedes, as in a beehive. Toward evening they began to come out in crowds to the San. We were at the <i xml:lang="sla">voevoda</i>’s quarters. Pan Kmita, who is called Babinich now, a soldier of the first degree, came up and reported this. But Pan Sapyeha was just sitting down to a feast, to which a multitude of noble women from Krasnik and Yanov had assembled⁠—for the <i xml:lang="sla">voevoda</i> is fond of the fair sex⁠—”</p>
			<p>“And he loves feasting!” interrupted Charnyetski.</p>
			<p>“I am not with him; there is no one to incline him to temperance,” put in Zagloba.</p>
			<p>“Maybe you will be with him sooner than you think; then you can both begin to be temperate,” retorted Charnyetski. Then he turned to Kharlamp: “Speak on!”</p>
			<p>“Babinich reported, and the <i xml:lang="sla">voevoda</i> answered: ‘They are only pretending to attack; they will undertake nothing! First,’ said he, ‘they will try to cross the Vistula; but I have an eye on them, and I will attack myself. At present,’ said he, ‘we will not spoil our pleasure, so that we may have a joyous time! We will eat and drink.’ The music began to tear away, and the <i xml:lang="sla">voevoda</i> invited those present to the dance.”</p>
			<p>“I’ll give him dancing!” interrupted Zagloba.</p>
			<p>“Silence, if you please!” said Charnyetski.</p>
			<p>“Again men rush in from the bank saying that there is a terrible uproar. ‘That’s nothing!’ the <i xml:lang="sla">voevoda</i> whispered to the page; ‘do not interrupt me!’ We danced till daylight, we slept till midday. At midday we see that the intrenchments are bristling, forty-eight pound guns on them; and the Swedes fire from time to time. When a ball falls it is the size of a bucket; it is nothing for such a one to fill the eyes with dust.”</p>
			<p>“Give no embellishments!” interrupted Charnyetski; “you are not with the hetman.”</p>
			<p>Kharlamp was greatly confused, and continued: “At midday the <i xml:lang="sla">voevoda</i> himself went out. The Swedes under cover of these trenches began to build a bridge. They worked till evening, to our great astonishment; for we thought that as to building they would build, but as to crossing they would not be able to do that. Next day they built on. The <i xml:lang="sla">voevoda</i> put the troops in order, for he expected a battle.”</p>
			<p>“All this time the bridge was a pretext, and they crossed lower down over another bridge, and turned your flank?” interrupted Charnyetski.</p>
			<p>Kharlamp stared and opened his mouth, he was silent in amazement; but at last said⁠—</p>
			<p>“Then your worthiness has had an account already?”</p>
			<p>“No need of that!” said Zagloba; “our grandfather guesses everything concerning war on the wing, as if he had seen it in fact.”</p>
			<p>“Speak on!” said Charnyetski.</p>
			<p>“Evening came. The troops were in readiness, but with the first star there was a feast again. This time the Swedes passed over the second bridge lower down, and attacked us at once. The squadron of Pan Koshyts, a good soldier, was at the edge. He rushed on them. The general militia which was next to him sprang to his aid; but when the Swedes spat at them from the guns, they took to their heels. Pan Koshyts was killed, and his men terribly cut up. Now the general militia, rushing back in a crowd on the camp, put everything in disorder. All the squadrons that were ready advanced; but we effected nothing, lost cannon besides. If the king had had more cannon and infantry, our defeat would have been severe; but fortunately the greater number of the infantry regiments with the cannon had sailed away in boats during the night. Of this no one of us knew.”</p>
			<p>“Sapyo has blundered! I knew it beforehand!” cried Zagloba.</p>
			<p>“We got the correspondence of the king,” added Kharlamp, “which the Swedes dropped. The soldiers read in it that the king is to go to Prussia to return with the elector’s forces, for, he writes, that with Swedish troops alone he cannot succeed.”</p>
			<p>“I know of that,” said Charnyetski. “Pan Sapyeha sent me that letter.” Then he muttered quietly, as if speaking to himself: “We must follow him to Prussia.”</p>
			<p>“That is what I have been saying this long time,” put in Zagloba.</p>
			<p>Charnyetski looked at him for a while in thoughtfulness. “It is unfortunate,” said he, aloud; “for if I had returned to Sandomir the hetman and I should not have let a foot of them out alive. Well! it has passed and will not return. The war will be longer; but death is fated to this invasion and to these invaders.”</p>
			<p>“It cannot be otherwise!” cried the knights in chorus; and great consolation entered their hearts, though a short time before they had doubted.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile Zagloba whispered something in Jendzian’s ear; he vanished through the door, and soon returned with a decanter. Seeing this, Volodyovski inclined to the knee of the castellan.</p>
			<p>“It would be an uncommon favor for a simple soldier,” he began.</p>
			<p>“I will drink with you willingly,” said Charnyetski; “and do you know why?⁠—because we must part.”</p>
			<p>“How is that?” cried the astonished Pan Michael.</p>
			<p>“Sapyeha writes that the Lauda squadron belongs to the Lithuanian army, and that he sent it only to assist the forces of the kingdom; that now he will need it himself, especially the officers, of whom he has a great lack. My Volodyovski, you know how much I love you; it is hard for me to part with you, but here is the order. It is true Pan Sapyeha as a courteous man leaves the order in my power and discretion. I might not show it to you.⁠—Well, it is as pleasant to me as if the hetman had broken my best sabre. I give you the order precisely because it is left to my discretion, and do your duty. To your health, my dear soldier!”</p>
			<p>Volodyovski bowed again to the castellan’s knees; but he was so distressed that he could not utter a word, and when Charnyetski embraced him tears ran in a stream over his yellow mustaches.</p>
			<p>“I would rather die!” cried he, pitifully. “I have grown accustomed to toil under you, revered leader, and there I know not how it will be.”</p>
			<p>“Pan Michael, do not mind the order,” cried Zagloba, with emotion. “I will write to Sapyo myself, and rub his ears for him fittingly.”</p>
			<p>But Pan Michael first of all was a soldier; therefore he flew into a passion⁠—</p>
			<p>“But the old volunteer is ever sitting in you. You would better be silent when you know not the question. Service!”</p>
			<p>“That is it,” said Charnyetski.</p>
