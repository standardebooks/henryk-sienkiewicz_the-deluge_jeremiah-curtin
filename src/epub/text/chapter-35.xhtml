			<p>To the supper, besides the sword-bearer of Rossyeni and Olenka, were invited the most distinguished officers of Kyedani and some attendants of Prince Boguslav. He came himself in such array and so lordly that he attracted all eyes. His wig was dressed in beautiful waving curls; his face in delicacy of color called to mind milk and roses; his small mustache seemed to be of silken hair, and his eyes stars. He was dressed in black, in a kaftan made of stripes of silk and velvet, the sleeves of which were slashed and fastened together the length of the arm. Around his neck he had a broad collar, of the most marvellous Brabant lace, of inestimable value, and at the wrists ruffles of the same material. A gold chain fell on his breast, and over the right shoulder along the whole kaftan went to his left hip a sword-strap of Dutch leather, so set with diamonds that it looked like a strip of changing light. The hilt of his sword glittered in like manner, and in his shoe-buckles gleamed the two largest diamonds, as large as hazelnuts. The whole figure seemed imposing, and as noble as it was beautiful.</p>
			<p>In one hand he held a lace handkerchief; in the other he carried, according to the fashion of the time, on his sword-hilt, a hat adorned with curling black ostrich feathers of uncommon length.</p>
			<p>All, not excepting Prince Yanush, looked at him with wonder and admiration. His youthful years came to the memory of the prince <i xml:lang="sla">voevoda</i>, when he in the same way surpassed all at the French court with his beauty and his wealth. Those years were now far away, but it seemed at that moment to the hetman that he was living again in that brilliant cavalier who bore the same name.</p>
			<p>Prince Yanush grew vivacious, and in passing he touched with his index finger the breast of his cousin.</p>
			<p>“Light strikes from you as from the moon,” said he. “Is it not for Panna Billevich that you are so arrayed?”</p>
			<p>“The moon enters easily everywhere,” answered Boguslav, boastingly.</p>
			<p>And then he began to talk with Ganhoff, near whom he halted, perhaps of purpose to exhibit himself the better, for Ganhoff was a man marvellously ugly; he had a face dark and pitted with smallpox, a nose like the beak of a hawk, and mustaches curled upward. He looked like the spirit of darkness, but Boguslav near him like the spirit of light.</p>
			<p>The ladies entered⁠—Pani Korf and Olenka. Boguslav cast a swift glance at Olenka, and bowed promptly to Pani Korf; he was just putting his fingers to his mouth, to send in cavalier fashion a kiss to Panna Billevich, when he saw her exquisite beauty, both proud and dignified. He changed his tactics in an instant, caught his hat in his right hand, and advancing toward the lady bowed so low that he almost bent in two; the curls of his wig fell on both sides of his shoulders, his sword took a position parallel with the floor, and he remained thus, moving purposely his cap and sweeping the floor in front of Olenka with the ostrich feather, in sign of respect. A more courtly homage he could not have given to the Queen of France. Panna Billevich, who had learned of his coming, divined at once who stood before her; therefore seizing her robe with the tips of her fingers, she gave him in return a courtesy equally profound.</p>
			<p>All wondered at the beauty and grace of manners of the two, which was evident from the greeting itself⁠—grace not over usual in Kyedani, for, as a Wallachian, Yanush’s princess was more in love with eastern splendor than with courtliness, and Yanush’s daughter was still a little girl.</p>
			<p>Boguslav now raised his head, shook the curls of his wig over his shoulders, and striking his heels together with force, moved quickly toward Olenka; at the same time he threw his hat to a page and gave her his hand.</p>
			<p>“I do not believe my eyes, and see as it were in a dream what I see,” said he, conducting her to the table; “but tell me, beautiful goddess, by what miracle you have descended from Olympus to Kyedani?”</p>
			<p>“Though simply a noble woman, not a goddess,” answered Olenka, “I am not so simple-minded as to take the words of your highness as anything beyond courtesy.”</p>
			<p>“Though I tried to be politest of all, your glass would tell more than I.”</p>
			<p>“It would not tell more, but more truly,” answered Olenka, pursing her mouth according to the fashion of the time.</p>
			<p>“Were there a mirror in the room, I would conduct you to it straightway; meanwhile look into my eyes, and you will see if their admiration is not sincere.”</p>
			<p>Here Boguslav bent his head before Olenka; his eyes gleamed large, black as velvet, sweet, piercing, and at the same time burning. Under the influence of their fire the maiden’s face was covered with a purple blush. She dropped her glance and pushed away somewhat, for she felt that with his arm Boguslav pressed lightly her arm to his side.</p>
			<p>So he came to the table. He sat near her, and it was evident that in truth her beauty had made an uncommon impression on him. He expected to find a woman of the nobles, shapely as a deer, laughing and playful as a nutcracker, ruddy as a poppy-flower; but he found a proud lady, in whose black brows unbending will was revealed, in whose eyes were reason and dignity, in whose whole face was the transparent repose of a child; and at the same time she was so noble in bearing, so charming and wonderful, that at any king’s castle she might be the object of homage and courtship from the first cavaliers of the realm.</p>
			<p>Her beauty aroused admiration and desire; but at the same time there was in it a majesty which curbed these, so that despite himself Boguslav thought, “I pressed her arm too early; with such a one subtlety is needed, not haste!”</p>
			<p>Nevertheless he determined to possess her heart, and he felt a wild delight at the thought that the moment would come when the majesty of the maiden and that purest beauty would yield to his love or his hatred. The threatening face of Kmita stood athwart these imaginings; but to that insolent man this was but an incentive the more. Under the influence of these feelings he grew radiant; blood began to play in him, as in an Oriental steed; all his faculties flashed up uncommonly, and light gleamed from his whole form as from his diamonds.</p>
			<p>Conversation at the table became general, or rather it was turned into a universal chorus of praise and flattery of Boguslav, which the brilliant cavalier heard with a smile, but without overweening delight, since it was common and of daily occurrence. They spoke first of his military deeds and duels. The names of the conquered princes, margraves, barons, streamed as if out of a sleeve. He threw in carelessly from time to time one more. The listeners were astonished; Prince Yanush stroked his long mustaches with delight, and at last Ganhoff said⁠—</p>
			<p>“Even if fortune and birth did not stand in my way, I should not like to stand in the way of your highness, and the only wonder to me is that men of such daring have been found.”</p>
			<p>“What is to be done, Ganhoff? There are men of iron visage and wildcat glance, whose appearance alone causes terror; but God has denied me that power⁠—even a young lady would not be frightened at my face.”</p>
			<p>“Just as darkness is not afraid of a torch,” said Pani Korf, simpering and posing, “until the torch burns in it.”</p>
			<p>Boguslav laughed, and Pani Korf talked on without ceasing to pose⁠—</p>
			<p>“Duels concern soldiers more, but we ladies would be glad to hear of your love affairs, tidings of which have come to us.”</p>
			<p>“Untrue ones, my lady benefactress, untrue⁠—they have all merely grown on the road. Proposals were made for me, of course. Her Grace, the Queen of France was so kind⁠—”</p>
			<p>“With the Princess de Rohan,” added Yanush.</p>
			<p>“With another too⁠—De la Forse,” added Boguslav; “but even a king cannot command his own heart to love, and we do not need, praise be to God, to seek wealth in France, hence there could be no bread out of that flour. Graceful ladies they were, ’tis true, and beautiful beyond imagination; but we have still more beautiful, and I need not go out of this hall to find such.”</p>
			<p>Here he looked long at Olenka, who, feigning not to hear, began to say something to the sword-bearer; and Pani Korf raised her voice again⁠—</p>
			<p>“There is no lack here of beauties; still there are none who in fortune and birth could be the equal of your highness.”</p>
			<p>“Permit me, my benefactress, to differ,” responded Boguslav, with animation; “for first I do not think that a Polish noble lady is inferior in any way to a Rohan or De la Forse; second, it is not a novelty for the Radzivills to marry a noble woman, since history gives many examples of that. I assure you, my benefactress, that that noble lady who should become Radzivill would have the step and precedence of princesses in France.”</p>
			<p>“An affable lord!” whispered the sword-bearer to Olenka.</p>
			<p>“That is how I have always understood,” continued Boguslav, “though more than once have I been ashamed of Polish nobles, when I compare them with those abroad; for never would that have happened there which has happened in this Commonwealth⁠—that all should desert their king, nay, even men are ready to lay in wait for his life. A French noble may permit the worst action, but he will not betray his king⁠—”</p>
			<p>Those present began to look at one another and at the prince with astonishment. Prince Yanush frowned and grew stern; but Olenka fixed her blue eyes on Boguslav’s face with an expression of admiration and thankfulness.</p>
			<p>“Pardon, your highness,” said Boguslav, turning to Yanush, who was not able yet to recover himself, “I know that you could not act otherwise, for all Lithuania would have perished if you had followed my advice; but respecting you as older, and loving you as a brother, I shall not cease to dispute with you touching Yan Kazimir. We are among ourselves, I speak therefore what I think. Our insufficiently lamented king, good, kind, pious, and doubly dear to me⁠—I was the first of Poles to attend him when he was freed from durance in France. I was almost a child at the time, but all the more I shall never forget him; and gladly would I give my blood to protect him, at least from those who plot against his sacred person.”</p>
			<p>Though Yanush understood Boguslav’s game now, still it seemed to him too bold and too hazardous for such a trifling object; therefore without hiding his displeasure he said⁠—</p>
			<p>“In God’s name, of what designs against the safety of our ex-king are you speaking? Who cherishes them, where could such a monster be found among the Polish people? True as life, such a thing has not happened in the Commonwealth since the beginning of the world.”</p>
			<p>Boguslav hung his head.</p>
			<p>“Not longer than a month ago,” said he, with sadness in his voice, “on the road between Podlyasye and Electoral Prussia, when I was going to Tanrogi, there came to me a noble of respectable family. That noble, not being aware of my real love for our gracious king, and thinking that I, like others, was an enemy of his, promised for a considerable reward to go to Silesia, carry off Yan Kazimir and deliver him to the Swedes, either living or dead.”</p>
			<p>All were dumb with amazement.</p>
			<p>“And when with anger and disgust I rejected such an offer,” said Boguslav, in conclusion, “that man with brazen forehead said, ‘I will go to Radzeyovski; he will buy and pay me gold by the pound.’ ”</p>
			<p>“I am not a friend of the ex-king,” said Yanush; “but if the noble had made me a proposal like that, I should have placed him by a wall, and in front of him six musketeers.”</p>
			<p>“At the first moment I wanted to do so, but did not,” answered Boguslav, “as the conversation was with four eyes, and people might cry out against the violence and tyranny of the Radzivills. I frightened him, however, by saying that Radzeyovski and the King of Sweden, even Hmelnitski, would put him to death for such a proposal; in one word, I brought that criminal so far that he abandoned his plan.”</p>
			<p>“That was not right; it was not proper to let him go living, he deserved at least the impaling-stake,” cried Korf.</p>
			<p>Boguslav turned suddenly to Yanush.</p>
			<p>“I cherish also the hope that punishment will not miss him, and first I propose that he perish not by an ordinary death; but your highness alone is able to punish him, for he is your attendant and your colonel.”</p>
			<p>“In God’s name! my colonel? Who is he⁠—who? Speak!”</p>
			<p>“His name is Kmita,” said Boguslav.</p>
			<p>“Kmita!” repeated all, with astonishment.</p>
			<p>“That is not true!” cried Panna Billevich at once, rising from her chair, with flashing eyes and heaving breast.</p>
			<p>Deep silence followed. Some had not recovered yet from the fearful news given by Boguslav; others were astonished at the boldness of that lady who had dared to throw a lie in the eyes of Prince Boguslav; the sword-bearer began to stutter, “Olenka! Olenka!” But Boguslav veiled his face in sorrow, and said without anger⁠—</p>
			<p>“If he is your relative or betrothed, I am grieved that I mentioned this fact; but cast him out of your heart, for he is not worthy of you, O lady.”</p>
			<p>She remained yet a moment in pain, flushed, and astonished; but by degrees her face became cool, until it was cold and pale. She sank down in the chair, and said⁠—</p>
			<p>“Forgive me, your highness, I made an unseemly contradiction. All is possible for that man.”</p>
			<p>“May God punish me if I feel aught save pity!” answered Boguslav, mildly.</p>
			<p>“He was the betrothed of this lady,” said Prince Yanush, “and I myself made the match. He was a young man, hotheaded; he caused a world of turmoil. I saved him from justice, for he was a good soldier. I saw that he was lawless, and would be; but that he, a noble, could think of such infamy, I did not expect.”</p>
			<p>“He is an evil man; that I knew long since,” said Ganhoff.</p>
			<p>“And why did you not forewarn me?” inquired Yanush, in a tone of reproach.</p>
			<p>“I was afraid that your highness might suspect me of envy, for he had everywhere the first step before me.”</p>
			<p>“<i xml:lang="la">Horribile dictu et auditu</i> (horrible in the speaking and the hearing),” said Korf.</p>
			<p>“Gracious gentlemen,” exclaimed Boguslav, “let us give peace to him. If it is grievous for you to hear of this, what must it be for Panna Billevich?”</p>
			<p>“Your highness, be pleased not to consider me,” said Olenka; “I can listen to everything now.”</p>
			<p>The evening was drawing toward its close. Water was given for the washing of fingers; then Prince Yanush rose first and gave his arm to Pani Korf, and Prince Boguslav to Olenka.</p>
			<p>“God has punished the traitor already,” said he to her; “for whoso has lost you has lost heaven. It is less than two hours since I first saw you, charming lady, and I should be glad to see you forever, not in pain and in tears, but in joy and in happiness.”</p>
			<p>“I thank your highness,” answered Olenka.</p>
			<p>After the departure of the ladies the men returned to the table to seek consolation in cups, which went around frequently. Prince Boguslav drank deeply, for he was satisfied with himself. Prince Yanush conversed with the sword-bearer of Rossyeni.</p>
			<p>“I march tomorrow with the army for Podlyasye,” said he. “A Swedish garrison will come to Kyedani. God knows when I shall return. You cannot stay here with the maiden; it would not be a fit place for her among soldiers. You will both go with Prince Boguslav to Taurogi, where she may stay with my wife among her ladies in waiting.”</p>
			<p>“Your highness,” answered the sword-bearer, “God has given us a corner of our own; why should we go to strange places? It is a great kindness of your highness to think of us: but not wishing to abuse favor, we prefer to return to our own roof.”</p>
			<p>The prince was unable to explain to the sword-bearer all the reasons for which he would not let Olenka out of his hands at any price; but some of them he told with all the rough outspokenness of a magnate.</p>
			<p>“If you wish to accept it as a favor, all the better, but I will tell you that it is precaution as well. You will be a hostage there; you will be responsible to me for all the Billeviches, who I know well do not rank themselves among my friends, and are ready to raise Jmud in rebellion when I am gone. Advise them to sit in peace, and do nothing against the Swedes, for your head and that of your niece will answer for their acts.”</p>
			<p>At this juncture patience was evidently lacking to the sword-bearer, for he answered quickly⁠—</p>
			<p>“It would be idle for me to appeal to my rights as a noble. Power is on the side of your highness, and it is all one to me where I must sit in prison; I prefer even that place to this.”</p>
			<p>“Enough!” said the prince, threateningly.</p>
			<p>“What is enough, is enough!” answered the sword-bearer. “God grant to this violence an end, and to justice new power. Speaking briefly, do not threaten, your highness, for I fear not.”</p>
			<p>Evidently Boguslav saw lightnings of anger gleaming on the face of Yanush, for he approached quickly.</p>
			<p>“What is the question?” asked he, standing between them.</p>
			<p>“I was telling the hetman,” said the sword-bearer, with irritation, “that I choose imprisonment in Taurogi rather than in Kyedani.”</p>
			<p>“In Taurogi there is for you not a prison, but my house, in which you will be as if at home. I know that the hetman chooses to see in you a hostage; I see only a dear guest.”</p>
			<p>“I thank your highness,” answered the sword-bearer.</p>
			<p>“And I thank you. Let us strike glasses and drink together, for they say that a libation must be made to friendship, or it will wither at its birth.”</p>
			<p>So saying, Boguslav conducted the sword-bearer to the table, and they fell to touching glasses and drinking to each other often and frequently. An hour later the sword-bearer turned with somewhat uncertain step toward his room, repeating in an undertone⁠—</p>
			<p>“An amiable lord! A worthy lord! A more honest one could not be found with a lantern⁠—gold, pure gold! I would gladly shed my blood for him!”</p>
			<p>Meanwhile the cousins found themselves alone. They had something yet to talk over, and besides, certain letters came; a page was sent to bring these from Ganhoff.</p>
			<p>“Evidently,” said Yanush, “there is not a word of truth in what you reported of Kmita?”</p>
			<p>“Evidently. You know best yourself. But, well? Acknowledge, was not Mazarin right? With one move to take terrible vengeance on an enemy, and to make a breach in that beautiful fortress⁠—well, who could do that? This is called intrigue worthy of the first court in the world! But that Panna Billevich is a pearl, and charming too, lordly and distinguished as if of princely blood. I thought I should spring from my skin.”</p>
			<p>“Remember that you have given your word⁠—remember that he will ruin us if he publishes those letters.”</p>
			<p>“What brows! What a queenly look, so that respect seizes one! Whence is there such a girl, such well-nigh royal majesty? I saw once in Antwerp, splendidly embroidered on Gobelin tapestry Diana hunting the curious Actaeon with dogs. She was like this one as cup is like cup.”</p>
			<p>“Look out that Kmita does not publish the letters, for then the dogs would gnaw us to death.”</p>
			<p>“Not true! I will turn Kmita into an Actaeon, and hunt him to death. I have struck him down on two fields, and it will come to battle between us yet.”</p>
			<p>Further conversation was interrupted by the entrance of a page with a letter. The <i xml:lang="sla">voevoda</i> of Vilna took the letter in his hand and made the sign of the cross. He did that always to guard against evil tidings; then, instead of opening, he began to examine it carefully. All at once his countenance changed.</p>
			<p>“Sapyeha’s arms are on the seal!” exclaimed he; “it is from the <i xml:lang="sla">voevoda</i> of Vityebsk.”</p>
			<p>“Open quickly!” said Boguslav.</p>
			<p>The hetman opened and began to read, interrupting himself from time to time with exclamations.</p>
			<p>“He is marching on Podlyasye! He asks if I have no messages for Tykotsin! An insult to me! Still worse; for listen to what he writes further⁠—</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:letter">
				<p>“ ‘Do you wish civil war, your highness? do you wish to sink one more sword in the bosom of the mother? If you do, come to Podlyasye. I am waiting for you, and I trust that God will punish your pride with my hands. But if you have pity on the country, if conscience stirs within you, if you value your deeds of past times and you wish to make reparation, the field is open before you. Instead of beginning a civil war, summon the general militia, raise the peasants, and strike the Swedes while Pontus, feeling secure, suspects nothing and is exercising no vigilance. From Hovanski you will have no hindrance, for reports come to me from Moscow that they are thinking there of an expedition against Livonia, though they keep that a secret. Besides, if Hovanski wished to undertake anything I hold him in check, and if I could have sincere trust I would certainly help you with all my forces to save the country. All depends on you, for there is time yet to turn from the road and efface your faults. Then it will appear clearly that you did not accept Swedish protection for personal purposes, but to avert final defeat from Lithuania. May God thus inspire you; for this I implore him daily, though your highness is pleased to accuse me of envy.</p>

			<p>“Have you heard?” asked Prince Yanush, when he had finished reading.</p>
			<p>“I have heard⁠—and what?” answered Boguslav, looking quickly at his cousin.</p>
			<p>“It would be necessary to abjure all, leave all, tear down our work with our own hands.”</p>
			<p>“Break with the powerful Karl Gustav, and seize the exiled Yan Kazimir by the feet, that he might deign to forgive and receive us back to his service, and also implore Sapyeha’s intercession.”</p>
			<p>Yanush’s face was filled with blood.</p>
			<p>“Have you considered how he writes to me: ‘Correct yourself, and I will forgive you,’ as a lord to an underling.”</p>
			<p>“He would write differently if six thousand sabres were hanging over his neck.”</p>
			<p>“Still⁠—” Here Prince Yanush fell to thinking gloomily.</p>
			<p>“Still, what?”</p>
			<p>“Perhaps for the country it would be salvation to do as Sapyeha advises.”</p>
			<p>“But for you⁠—for me, for the Radzivills?”</p>
			<p>Yanush made no answer; he dropped his head on his fists and thought.</p>
			<p>“Let it be so!” said he, at last; “let it be accomplished!”</p>
			<p>“What have you decided?”</p>
			<p>“Tomorrow I march on Podlyasye, and in a week I shall strike on Sapyeha.”</p>
			<p>“You are a Radzivill!” cried Boguslav. And they grasped each other’s hands.</p>
			<p>After a while Boguslav went to rest. Yanush remained alone. Once, and a second time he passed through the room with heavy steps. At last he clapped his hands. A page entered the room.</p>
			<p>“Let the astrologer come in an hour to me with a ready figure,” said he.</p>
			<p>The page went out, and the prince began again to walk and repeat his Calvinistic prayers. After that he sang a psalm in an undertone, stopping frequently, for his breath failed him, and looking from time to time through the window at the stars twinkling in the sky.</p>
			<p>By degrees the lights were quenched in the castle; but besides the astrologer and the prince one other person was watching in a room, and that was Olenka Billevich.</p>
			<p>Kneeling before her bed, she clasped both hands over her head, and whispered with closed eyes⁠—</p>
			<p>“Have mercy on us! Have mercy on us!”</p>
			<p>The first time since Kmita’s departure she would not, she could not pray for him.</p>
